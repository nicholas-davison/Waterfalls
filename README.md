#FallsFinder

##Introduction
FallsFinder is a platform to discover, share, and save information about waterfalls in the beautiful state of Tennessee. Users can create pages with detailed information on waterfalls in their area, save their favorite falls from the site, and get map directions to any of their favorite falls. 

##Purpose & motivation for project
Tennessee is home to hundreds of beautiful waterfalls, with a great number of them accessible on public land. My motivation for this project was to reinforce methods and techniques for CRUD application development, while learning about and displaying some of the waterfalls in Tennessee. I also was motivated to interact with commononly used APIs to gain experience in reading documentation and implementing code based on these instructions.

##How does the application work? (animations are always good)


##How was the application developed?
This application was developed using React and Vite, with state being managed within the application. Data is stored and retrieved via JSON server and Google Maps API.

##How to install and run the application.


##Difficulties & challenges faced during process.





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
